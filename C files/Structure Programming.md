### Computer Structure
1. Hardware (Basic components of a computer)

 1.CPU ( central processing unit )
  * ::Arithmetic logic unit::(ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations
  * ::Control Unit::, which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.
  * The ::Registers::, temporarily hold instructions and data

 2.GPU ( graphic processing unit )

 3.Memory
  * temporarily storage the data 
  * sometimes the CPU has Registers and also *cache memory* (level cache) 
 4.Communication devices

 5.Input devices
 6.output devices 
 7.Storage Devices
- - - -
2. Software
 * Application software 
 * System software 

3. Construction of a Programme
